# Forecasting Brasileir√£o 2023: A mathematical approach to the Brazilian soccer league in its current format

This is a project I had the opportunity to work on for a course during my time in Ohio University.
This project attempts to create a prediction algorithm over the Brazilian soccer league by using an unorthodox methodology.
For details on the project and explanations check the pdf file with the written article in the main repository.
